# Fashion-Mnist-Classification-using-Tensorflow
In this project, a fashion mnist dataset is used, which is almost similar to classic MNIST dataset, except that instead of handwritten digits from 0-9 , that is contained in MNIST, here there are various classes of articles like clothes, shoes, jeans , trousers etc. This classification problem is solved using Tensorflow.
